the CSV file has wrong Czech characters (like Å½ulovÃ¡ instead of Žulová).



That’s an encoding issue, caused by Excel not reading UTF-8 properly.



Here’s how to fix it 👇



✅ Option 1 (best for Excel)



Change this line:



with open(filename, "w", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as f:





to this:



with open(filename, "w", newline="", encoding="utf-8-sig") as f:





That small change adds a UTF-8 signature (BOM) at the start of the file — Excel will then open it with correct Czech characters like Žulová, Červená, Šumperk, etc.



✅ Option 2 (open correctly in Excel)



If you keep utf-8, then open the CSV manually in Excel like this:



Open Excel



Go to Data → Get Data → From Text/CSV



Choose your file



In the import window, set File Origin = UTF-8
